Absolutely — that’s a great idea. A clean, professional **README.md** will give your project identity and clarity for collaborators.

Here’s how I’d structure it conceptually for *Hermes*, your Kotlin blockchain:

---

# **Hermes 🕊️**
*A lightweight, educational blockchain implementation in Kotlin.*

---

## **Overview**

**Hermes** is a minimal, modular blockchain built with **Kotlin** and **Ktor**, designed to demonstrate core distributed ledger concepts such as:
- Peer-to-peer networking
- Proof-of-Work consensus
- Transaction propagation and mempool management
- Block and chain validation
- Merkle-tree hashing for transaction integrity

The focus is clean architecture, readability, and educational value — not production mining.

---

## **Architecture**

```
hermes/
 ├─ blockchain/     → Core data structures (Block, Chain, Transaction, Mempool)
 ├─ consensus/      → Consensus rules (PoW, chain replacement)
 ├─ network/        → P2P connectivity and message propagation
 ├─ routing/        → Ktor HTTP & WebSocket API endpoints
 ├─ util/           → Utility helpers (Merkle hashing, serialization)
 └─ Node.kt         → Entry point that wires all modules together
```

Each node runs its own embedded Ktor server and can connect to other peers to exchange blocks and transactions.

---

## **Features**

- **Proof of Work** consensus with adjustable difficulty
- **Mempool** for pending transactions
- **Merkle Root** computation for transaction integrity
- **P2P Communication** via HTTP/WebSockets
- **Modular Routing** for API separation (chain, peers, transactions, mining)
- **JSON API** powered by Ktor’s `ContentNegotiation` + `kotlinx.serialization`

---

## **Run a Local Network**

### **Build**
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### **Start a node**
```bash
java -jar build/libs/hermes.jar
```

Nodes will automatically try to connect and sync their chains.

---

## **Merkle Root Example**

Each block computes a Merkle root from its transactions:

```
Tx1   Tx2   Tx3   Tx4
 |      |     |     |
 h1     h2    h3    h4
  \    /       \   /
   h12          h34
       \       /
        Merkle Root
```

This root ensures the block’s proof of work commits to every transaction within it.
